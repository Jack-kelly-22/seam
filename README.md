# Seam

Your Simple, diverse and distributed yield gateway 

## What Problem does seam solve?

Although it would be comfortable to believe, inherent risks come with yield farming. Seam aims to solve this by mitigating risk through fragmenting deposits across top Celo defi protocols

## The vision

**we want to provide users with high fielding risk adverse pools fragmented across top cell deli protocols. Allowing users to hold an interest accumulating token representing secured deposits across protocols.**

## What is Seam?

Our project serves as a one stop shop for passive DeFi users. Actively researching pools and doing due diligence can take time, so our solution reduces the steps necessary to make this happen. 

## The Protocol

### Single Token In

Deposit Celo Dollars and weâ€™ll take care of the rest

## How is Seam different from other yield aggregators?

With our yield protocol users will be holding a single asset which represents deposits across pools. This mitigates some of the inherent risk involved in yield farming.
